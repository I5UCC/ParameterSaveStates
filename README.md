  - Find the blue icon that looks like a floppy disk in the SteamVR dashboard.

  - You can start ParameterSaveStates in the same way you autostart e.g. OVRAS or XSO by going to SteamVR Settings > Startup/Shutdown > Choose Startup Overlay Apps > Turn ParameterSaveStates to ON
- Save up to 20 profiles ***per avatar*** with custom naming
  - Setup the avatar the way you want to save it
  - hit `+ New`
  - Enter the Profiles Name
  - Click on the checkmark on the SteamVR Keyboard
- Apply profiles at will
  - Just hit Apply on any of the Profiles you have saved
- Copy profile sets between avatars, if e.g. You have the same avatar with other clothing choices or just more optimized versions.
  - Switch into the avatar you want to copy from first, then switch into the avatar you want to copy to, then press the "Copy from Last" button.
